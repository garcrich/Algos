## Problem Overview

Given a sorted integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, the task is to identify the ranges of numbers that are not present in `nums` but fall within the range `[lower, upper]`. A "missing range" is represented as an interval `[start, end]`, where `start` and `end` denote the beginning and end of the missing range, respectively.

## Solution Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start with a placeholder for the previous number as `lower - 1` to handle the case where the missing range starts from `lower`.
2. **Iterate Through `nums`**: Loop through each number in `nums` to find gaps between consecutive numbers that indicate missing ranges.
3. **Find Gaps**: For each number in `nums`, compare it with the next number (or `upper + 1` if it's the last number) to identify any gaps.
4. **Record Missing Ranges**: When a gap is found, calculate the start and end of the missing range and add it to the result list.
5. **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases, including when `nums` is empty or when there are missing ranges at the beginning or end of `[lower, upper]`.

## Key Points

- **Edge Handling**: The function starts and ends its search by explicitly considering `lower` and `upper` to ensure no missing ranges are overlooked.

- **Efficiency**: By iterating through `nums` only once and using simple arithmetic to find missing ranges, the function maintains O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of `nums`.

- **Result Format**: Missing ranges are returned as a list of intervals, each represented by a two-element array `[start, end]`.
