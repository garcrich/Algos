# Validate Number

## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number

### Problem Statement
Given a string, return true if the string is a valid number. A valid number can include integers, decimals, and also numbers with an exponent part. The definition encompasses various formats, including optional leading '+' or '-' signs, a decimal point, and 'e' or 'E' to denote the exponent part. The challenge is to correctly identify valid numbers while excluding invalid formats, such as numbers with multiple decimal points, misplaced signs, or incorrect exponent usage.

### Solution Approach
The solution iterates through the string, applying checks to ensure each character contributes to forming a valid number. It uses flags to track the appearance of digits, decimal points, and the exponent character. By checking the sequence and placement of these elements, the solution verifies the string's adherence to the rules for valid numbers. This approach divides the validation into manageable parts, handling the base number and its potential exponent part separately.

### Big O Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The algorithm needs to iterate through each character of the string once to check its validity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the space used does not scale with the input size. The algorithm uses a fixed number of variables to track the state and progress through the string.

### Key Insights
- **Boolean Flags for State Tracking**: Using simple boolean flags to remember whether specific conditions (like seeing a digit or a decimal point) have been met simplifies the logic and makes the code easier to follow.
- **Sequential Checks for Structure**: The solution's sequential checks align with how numbers are structured, validating the placement of signs, digits, decimal points, and exponent indicators in turn.
- **Flexibility and Rigor**: The approach balances flexibility in accepting various valid number formats with rigor in excluding invalid ones, mirroring the dual requirements of the problem statement.

### Real-World Applications
- **Input Validation**: This algorithm can be used in software applications that require strict validation of user input, ensuring that numbers are entered in a valid format before processing.
- **Data Parsing**: In scenarios where data comes in as strings (e.g., reading text files or user input), this solution helps parse and validate numerical data efficiently.
- **Configuration and Setting Management**: For applications that read configuration from files or user input, ensuring numerical settings are valid before applying them can prevent errors and ensure smooth operation.
