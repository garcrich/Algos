# Product of Two Run-Length Encoded Arrays

## Problem
[LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-two-run-length-encoded-arrays)

## Problem Statement
Given two run-length encoded (RLE) arrays representing two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, calculate the product of `nums1` and `nums2` and return the result in a run-length encoded format. Each `encoded[i] = [vali, freqi]` pair describes a segment of repeated numbers in `nums` where `vali` is the value repeated `freqi` times. The goal is to compute the element-wise product of `nums1` and `nums2` (assuming they are expanded) and return the product in RLE format.

## Solution Approach
The solution utilizes a direct manipulation approach to process the RLE arrays without fully expanding them. This involves iterating through the segments of both `encoded1` and `encoded2`, multiplying the values of corresponding segments, and accumulating the product in a new RLE array. The process is efficiently handled using a while loop and two pointers, each tracking the current segment in `encoded1` and `encoded2`. The key steps include:
1. Iterating through each segment of `encoded1` and `encoded2` simultaneously, using pointers.
2. Calculating the product of corresponding segments.
3. Managing the frequencies to correctly accumulate the products, adjusting for overlapping and non-overlapping segments.
4. Constructing the resulting RLE product array with minimal length, ensuring that consecutive products are merged when possible.

## Big O Complexity

### Time Complexity
**O(N + M)**, where `N` and `M` are the lengths of the run-length encoded arrays `encoded1` and `encoded2`, respectively. The complexity arises from the need to iterate through each segment of the input arrays once.

### Space Complexity
**O(Q)**, where `Q` is the number of segments in the resulting RLE product array. This space is required to store the result, which is typically less than the space that would be needed for the full expansion of the input arrays.

## Key Insights

- **Efficient RLE Manipulation**: Directly processing the RLE arrays without expanding them is key to maintaining efficiency, both in time and space.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: Utilizing pointers to iterate through the RLE arrays allows for effective synchronization of the segments being processed.
- **Merging Product Segments**: Carefully merging consecutive segments with the same product value in the result array ensures the run-length encoding remains compact.
- **Handling Overlapping Segments**: The approach correctly handles segments with different frequencies, ensuring that products are accurately computed and accumulated.

## Real-World Applications

- **Data Compression**: The technique demonstrates efficient manipulation of compressed data, applicable in scenarios where storage or bandwidth is limited.
- **Image Processing**: Run-length encoding is used in image compression formats; understanding how to operate directly on RLE data can be valuable for developing or optimizing image processing algorithms.
- **Signal Processing**: Similar techniques can be applied to the processing of signal data that has been compressed using RLE or similar schemes, optimizing operations such as filtering or transformation without decompression.
