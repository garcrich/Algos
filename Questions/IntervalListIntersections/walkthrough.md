# Interval List Intersections

## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections

### Problem Statement
Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order. Return the intersection of these two interval lists. A closed interval `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`. The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are both in the first interval and the second interval.

### Solution Approach
The solution uses a two-pointer approach to iterate through both interval lists simultaneously. By comparing the start and end points of intervals from both lists, it determines their intersection. This approach efficiently finds all intersections by advancing in one list or the other based on the end points of the current intervals, ensuring that no potential intersection is missed while avoiding unnecessary comparisons.

### Big O Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the first and second interval lists, respectively. Each list is traversed at most once, making the algorithm linear in the size of the input.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of intersecting intervals. The space used depends on the number of intersections found, which in the worst case could be proportional to the smaller of the two lists.

### Key Insights
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: This approach efficiently compares intervals from two lists without needing to merge them, taking advantage of the lists' sorted order.
- **Max/Min Functions for Intersection**: Using `Math.max` to find the start of the intersection and `Math.min` to find the end simplifies the calculation, clearly expressing the logic to find overlapping intervals.
- **Conditional Advancement**: Advancing the pointer in the list with the earlier ending interval ensures the algorithm always progresses toward finding the next intersection without overlooking any possibilities.

### Real-World Applications
- **Calendar and Scheduling**: This algorithm can identify overlapping appointments or available time slots in scheduling applications, helping to manage resources or plan meetings.
- **Data Range Analysis**: In data analysis, finding the intersection of ranges can help identify overlapping periods of interest across different datasets, such as economic indicators or environmental data readings.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Identifying overlapping time intervals in network traffic data can help in analyzing traffic bursts, maintenance windows, or security breaches.
